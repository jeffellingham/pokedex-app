# Pokedex app, GO!

This app was designed for the average, working trainer who needs a simple, portable Pokedex for their quest to catch 'em all! 

Specifically, the app covers every Pokemon from the original games that took the world by storm in the late 1990s. The trainer/user can view all the Pokemon, search for a specific one, or filter them by type. Also, if the trainer/user clicks on a Pokemon, they'll be shown a plethora of important information needed to aid them as they battle and capture it.

Lastly, this Pokedex will be *quite* aesthetically pleasing to the trainer's eyes, if I say so myself. If you don't believe me, [check it out for yourself](https://jeffellingham.github.io/pokedex-app).

## Technical aspects

This Pokedex and its creator owe a big thanks to **PokeAPI** and *its creators*, because that API was invaluable in bringing this app to life.
